# Honeysuckles Design: Brand Guidelines

## 1. Brand Philosophy & Tone

The core message is about helping clients "bloom" through thoughtful branding and digital experiences.

## 2. Color Palette

The color palette is directly inspired by the honeysuckle flower and the agency's existing logo and website. It is a natural, muted, and sophisticated palette.

| **Background** (White) | `#FFFFFF` | Clean, open space for a calm and elegant feel. |

## 3. Typography

The brand uses a combination of a refined serif for headings and a clean sans-serif for body text, reflecting the balance between elegance and modern clarity.

| Type | Font Style | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Headings** | Elegant Serif (e.g., Playfair Display, EB Garamond) | Titles, major calls-to-action, and brand name. Conveys sophistication and heritage. |
| **Body Text** | Clean Sans-Serif (e.g., Montserrat, Open Sans) | Paragraphs, navigation, and functional text. Ensures high readability and modern feel. |

## 4. Iconography

The icon set is designed to be **minimalist, line-art, and botanical-themed**, aligning with the overall brand aesthetic. They should be used to represent services or key features in a clean, elegant manner.

**Style:** Single-weight line art, featuring subtle honeysuckle or leaf elements.
**Color:** Primary Green (`#6B856B`) on a white or cream background.

## 5. Instagram Inspiration

The Instagram feed should maintain the brand's calm, elegant, and nature-inspired aesthetic. Content should focus on design tips, client success stories, and the thoughtful design process.

**Content Pillars:**
1.  **Design Education:** Quick, actionable tips on web design, branding, and accessibility. (e.g., `ig_tip_of_the_day.png`)
2.  **Client Showcase:** Elegant spotlights on completed projects, focusing on the "bloom" achieved. (e.g., `ig_client_spotlight.png`)
3.  **Process & Craft:** Behind-the-scenes looks at the design process, tools, and philosophy. (e.g., `ig_process_post.png`)

**Visual Style:**
*   Use the brand color palette consistently.
*   Prioritize clean layouts and ample white space.
*   Incorporate subtle botanical elements (line art, shadows of leaves).
*   Use high-quality, naturally lit photography for process posts.
